    "SWU uses Jenzabar as our Student Information System (SIS) and each semester I use the SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) pre-created reports to pull data to calculate faculty load in preparation for payroll. The process of preparting load and payroll takes about a week's worth of work cleaning data from the SSRS reports, coordinating with faculty and chairs, and double/triple checking things with payroll. So, in the spirit of automation, I thought that I'd share this Python load report creator since it has greatly helped me reduce the time spent in preparting loads while also minimizing data entry and manipulation errors due to manually adjusting Excel spreadsheets (the old way!).\n",
